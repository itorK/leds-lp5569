This is experimental module as a LED driver for NBG7815 device.

Usage:
1. Put module in the openwrt path -> /openwrt/package/kernel

2. make menuconfig and add a support for this driver as a module

3. Compile openwrt distro or just module(and send to the router):
```
make V=sc package/kernel/leds-lp5569/compile
```

4. Play fun with leds as example:
